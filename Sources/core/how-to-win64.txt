1) Install Visual Studio 2015 (https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx)
- in the installation wizard, allow installation of the following components:
    Programming Languages - Visual C++ - Common Tools for Visual C++ 2015
    Windows and Web Development - Universal Windows App Development Tools - Windows 10 SDK
- after installation, launch Visual Studio and go to options to change the default C++ indenting behaviour to use spaces instead of tabs:
    Tools - Options - Text Editor - C/C++ - Tab - Insert spaces

2) Install Cygwin (https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe)
- in the installation wizard, ensure there are no spaces in the path to Root Install Directory
- in the installation wizard, allow installation of the following components:
    Archive - unzip, Web - wget, Devel - make, Devel - makedepend, Devel - gcc-core
- after installation, go to Cygwin installation directory, open cygwin.bat and insert following line just under @echo off
    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall" amd64
- add Cygwin bin directory to the system Path variable (e.g. C:\cygwin64\bin)
    Control panel - System - Advanced system settings - Environment Variables - System variables

3) Build dependencies
- run Cygwin via cygwin.bat (not via Desktop or Start menu shortcuts)
    e.g. C:\cygwin64\cygwin.bat
- in the Cygwin commnad prompt, execute the following commands:
    cd /cygdrive/c/somedir/arnold/libs
    ./build-libs-win64.sh all
- note: fatal errors during charm++ compilation are expected (it tries to compile memory allocation and threading implementations opportunistically even for different platforms)

4) Build solution
- open the following solution file in Visual Studio:
    .\core\core.sln
- in Visual Studio, select Debug/Release configuration, go to menu 'Build - Build solution' and wait until the compilation succeeds

5) Launch binaries
- built binaries and their dependencies are to be found under the following directories:
    .\core\debug
    .\core\release

Assumptions:
- Path to this directory does not contain any spaces (copy the scripts elsewhere if it does).
- Internet connection available to download additional packages.

Notes:
- Scripts are otherwise self-sufficient and will download everything they need.
- Scripts work solely in this directory, do not install anything and do not change the system in any way.
- In case the script cannot download some dependency from Internet, download it manually from backup at [1], put it to this directory and run the script again.
